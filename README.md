# TheCureTrust-Privacy-Policy


Welcome to the The Cure Trust app for Android!

This is a free education related Android app developed by Cure Trust. The app is available on Google Play.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The app will only acquire location permission to get Prayer timings & Qiblah Direction.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, thecuretrust@gmail.com
